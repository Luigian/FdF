# FdF

This project was my first approach to the basics of graphic programming, i learned how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint. I worked with the miniLibX graphic library to open a window, light a pixel and deal with mouse and keyboard events.

One of the most interesting parts, in my opinion, is to deal with the calculation of gradients in the lines, which helped me to better understand the way in which the color is encoded in its the three channels and the proper manipulation of these.
